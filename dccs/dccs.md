>Hi Chris, I understand from Alan that at some point you may be developing the web version of the DCCS test (one of the cognitive tests for Biobank).
I’ve developed the C++ builder version of this test, at least, up to the point where Alan integrates it into the rest of the software for the imaging clinic. The code is sitting in CVS, along with an executable that shows how it works, under module scurtis/clinic-tests/dccs
There’s also some documentation, linked to from the core programming wiki, see
http://arrakis.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/~cp/clinic/dccs/docs/
The reason I’m mentioning it now, is that in approx a week’s time, I’m going to be taking a few months of unpaid leave. This at least gives you some opportunity to run the executable, have a look around the documentation/code, and discuss. It’s probably the DCCSspec class that could do with a brief chat, since that is where the “human version” of the NIH specification got translated into code, which is the bit that I daresay will be most relevant for you.
(Do you know whether you are developing the web version of the picture vocabulary test too? I have been developing that one as well but it’s not finished yet.) Sharon

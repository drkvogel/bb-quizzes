AY re starting with Matrix-

>Dear Jonathan+Chris, as discussed with you separately, I'd like Chris to produce online versions of the new cognitive tests that are being rolled out in the touchscreen systems.  Jonathan, please can you explain the tests and demo the touchscreen versions to Chris and make the various graphical materials available to him - your standalone program that I sent to UKB would be a good framework for this.  It might also be useful to pass on the front-end code done by Cardiff in case there's stuff in there that can be re-used - I'd like the back-end in c++ rather than php, but the rest ought to be relevant.
I'll raise bugzilla entries for these jobs.  I'm not fussed which of the two is done first, but I would like a particular one chosen rather than both done in parallel. Alan

>The Matrix questionnaire is part of the touchscreen system.  We require an online version of it suitable for "at home" use by participants on a variety of devices ranging from full-size desktops to smartphones.
System should have a back-end cgi in c++ responsible for initiating the test (i.e. accepting a participant identifier) and saving the results to a database on completion.   Front-end should be delivered locally by Javascript.

Scale to allow for height

thought: why am I adding up the heights of everything on the page when I could do (height of body) - (height of element to be scaled) and scale vs window.height?
in fact, could genericise:

```js
function scaleElement(elementSelector) {
   var heightExtra = $("body").height() - $(elementSelector).height();
   ...
}
```


another thought: 
dont' need natural dims - just work out h/w ratio from current dims, how much extra height, what height required, therefore what width, therefore what margins
should work on all as long as middle content is in a containing div. no need to mess around with SVG DOM.


## defer

jQuery gets properties across document boundaries? And in this case, current, not natural dimensions:

    $('#svg1').height()
    154.1875

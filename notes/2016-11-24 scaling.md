Scale to allow for height

thought: why am I adding up the heights of everything on the page when I could do (height of body) - (height of element to be scaled) and scale vs window.height?
in fact, could genericise:

```js
function scaleElement(elementSelector) {
   var heightExtra = $("body").height() - $(elementSelector).height();
   ...
}
```



jQuery gets properties across document boundaries? And in this case, current, not natural dimensions:

    $('#svg1').height()
    154.1875

scaleImages() currently only fired onresize

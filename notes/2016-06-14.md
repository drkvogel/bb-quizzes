prev button doesn't respond when navbar collapsed due to small screen width
2nd to last image (coloured squares) bottom grid not aligned with image map

hoops: image stops stretching horizontally because .container has a set width - clear this and it will stretch the whole width

    @media (min-width: 768px)
    .container {
        width: 750px;
    }

hoops doesn't scale automatically on page load, only on resize
use your scaling algorithm on Hoops instead of my simple one; needs re-investigation of page elements - pesticide
    simple scaling works - but not triggered at right time
save results to backend fully â€“ should be simple to do now backend framework exists
describe hoops scaling algorithm in documentation (this is why the Hoops documentation is still not complete)
buttons scroll off bottom on phone - text too lengthy? too much spacing?
images should be bigger on phone



## done

http://xrat/~cp/bbquiz/idserve.cgi insert date/random number- parse-
%s instead of %d segfault, schoolboy C++ error
jQuery seems to have escaped JSON.stringify(responses) - copy from view-source, doublequotes copy as `&quot;`

### hoops.o makefile weirdness

looks like responses are put in hidden input from hoops on red, but doesn't seem to trigger correct part of backend, as though there were no parameters
crashed, that's why. too big?

    [cp@red sql]$ sudo less /var/log/httpd/error_log
    [Tue Sep 13 18:41:50 2016] [error] [client 10.140.150.200] terminate called after throwing an instance of 'char const*',

doesn't look like hoops.o got built any time recently... well, 16:45 today
make clean make bbquiz - doesn't build - hadn't noticed $(OJBS) appearing twice in make target
now bbquiz.cgi calls into hoops.o

### bigger touch area for circles

extending downwards perhaps

trails: ellipse cy + 5 rx 25 ry 30
transparency not officially part of svg spec, though many UAs support it
stroke="none" fill="none" but then loses events... because fill is "none" and not "white", i.e. is hollow? yes. set fill in order to respond to click
with stroke-width="none", ellipse outline can still be seen....  use stroke="white"
lines are drawn before and therefore under circles/groups so that segment within circle originating at circle centre is obscured
with extra elliptical touch area, line gets broken when drawn under it
on correct click, remove ellipse just before showing line?

OK, so as http://kvogel.net/responsive/tables has proved (?), there are really two problems:

1. The tiles do not stretch, and therefore:
2. The grids are a fixed size that fills most of the width and height - on my laptop, where the screen is 1920 x 1080, and therefore the aspect ratio is 16:9, the height cannot fit and scrolls off the screen

so:

1. The tile images should scale
2. the page height should fit in the viewport hight, and the width adjust as necessary

As I'm using sprites, I should perhaps use stretchy sprites, or 

Stretchy Sprites
doesn't use `background-size`

```css
/*
Stretchy Sprites by tobyj.net
Feel free to copy and reuse as you like
*/

/*Set the max-width to the width of your individual sprites:*/
.stretchy {display:block; float:left; position:relative; overflow:hidden; max-width:160px;}
.stretchy .spacer {width: 100%; height: auto;}
.stretchy .sprite {position:absolute; top:0; left:0; max-width:none; max-height:100%;}
.stretchy .sprite.s2 {left:-100%;}
.stretchy .sprite.s3 {left:-200%;}
.stretchy .sprite.s4 {left:-300%;}
.stretchy .sprite.s5 {left:-400%;}
.stretchy .sprite.s6 {left:-500%;}

.stretchy.no-limit {max-width: none;} /*you could also set this to a pixel size, for example 320px, to limit the maximum*/
.stretchy.no-limit .sprite {min-height: 100%;}

/*END stretchy sprites by tobyj.net*/
```



`background-size` doesn't work in IE8

>Not much, I’m afraid.  One obvious question, though: how have you specified the viewport?
>I’m never quite sure about device-width on PCs, unless the browser’s operating full screen, but I wonder if the problem is the different devices are interpreting it differently.  If it wasn’t there, my guess is that they’d all try to do the decent thing. Sorry; not much more I can offer Nick

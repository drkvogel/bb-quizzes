make localhost deployments go to complete.php again
quizzes on mobiles generally - should use all available space

## defer

still have to copy bb-quizzes/db/sql from oqshub to oqsweb to rebuild db
or, could do with vnode from hub to web
but netutil is horrible - get team ingres to do
editing:
probably best to do all from q108-vlubuntu, and manually upload to oqshub (c++) or oqsweb (sql) from sublime-sftp, rather than edit remote, which doesn't change local file (thus changes not seen in repo and have to sync with remote)
in fact by doing this, could do edit backend c++ and build on oqsweb so no need to use oqshub at all...

### progress

docs: timings: when started,  cut-offs at various points, behaviour If time exceeded

#### done

Collect timings (for all 4 puzzles) and save to database-/
Begin documentation
Prevent highlighting of circled text is user "selects" it
Determine contact emails for primary SMS users

ay re timings
deltas or absolute?
precision?
how to store arbitrary number of timings?

## done

void Trails::parseResponses(TrailsRecord *rec) - is there a buffer overrun there? yes, instead of:

        char buf[1600];
        strcpy(buf, rec->responses.c_str()); // assumes buf[] big enough

did:

        char * buf = new char[rec->responses.length() + 1]; // always big enough
        strcpy(buf, rec->responses.c_str());

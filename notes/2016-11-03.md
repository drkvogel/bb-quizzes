make localhost deployments go to complete.php again
still have to copy bb-quizzes/db/sql from oqshub to oqsweb to rebuild db
or, could do with vnode from hub to web
but netutil is horrible - get team ingres to do
editing:
probably best to do all from q108-vlubuntu, and manually upload to oqshub (c++) or oqsweb (sql) from sublime-sftp, rather than edit remote, which doesn't change local file (thus changes not seen in repo and have to sync with remote)
in fact by doing this, could do edit backend c++ and build on oqsweb so no need to use oqshub at all...

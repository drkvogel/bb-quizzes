do calcs to take into account containing divs
and/or remove some containing divs

currently: var margin = ($(window).width() - $(window).height()) / 2; 

var margin = ($(window).width() - $(window).height() - (all div margins)) / 2; 
var margin = ($(window).width() - $(window).height() - ($('body').attr('width') + $('div.container').attr('width') + $('div#pages').attr('width'))
)) / 2; 

 x dcontaining:
body
div.container
div#pages

contained:
div.quiz#quiz-2x2
div.quizContainer

>The difference between .css(width) and .width() is that the latter returns a unit-less pixel value (for example, 400) while the former returns a value with units intact (for example, 400px). The .width() method is recommended when an element's width needs to be used in a mathematical calculation.

use calc() to keep .top, .bot same scale?

diigo app support ticket-
Fix the Android app. It doesn't sync reliably, and loses bookmarks.
The Diigo Android app sometimes fails (silently) to save bookmarks, and doesn't sync to the server. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It is not reliable. If I cannot rely on the mobile app to save my bookmarks, it becomes of little use, and by extension, so does Diigo itself, so unless this is fixed, I will have to use a different bookmarking service.

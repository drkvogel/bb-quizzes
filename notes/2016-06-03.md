hack 2images/images into 2images
html 
js


differences in main.js, main.scss, index.html, images
e.g. 
main looks same as jprice as 2images as sstose

compare with

## done

yak shaving:

### keep different versions of matrix/yo/app

/home/cbird/Projects/bb-quizzes/matrix/dev/screencaps/2images
could change gulpfile to serve/build different versions, but "app" is hardcoded in many places....
better, symbolic link app-mybranch -> app
jprice sstose cbird 2images
in fact, could share yo dev environment between all apps, matrix, hoops etc
and have a little script that links "app" to the given 

### Run a command that is shadowed by an alias

You can also prefix a back slash to disable the alias: `\ls`
Use "command": `command ls`
Use the full path: `/bin/ls`
Quote the command: `"ls"` or `'ls'`
You can remove the alias temporarily for that terminal session with `unalias command_name`

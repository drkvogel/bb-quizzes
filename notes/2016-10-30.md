    addListeners adds listener onload - every time? no - should just once in init
    svg1 is the same (html) object throughout, but has different content loaded
    removeEventListener before?? not the svg1 load, but the group.addEventListener s inside it? shouldn't matter
    does sth different happen on click Start vs devBar Next? yes
    containerClick() is being called multiple times
        set in showPage2, which is being called multiple times
    maybe race with svg1 on load?
Start
devBar Next
    misses $('#pages').off('click',... )

    function containerClick(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        $('#pages').off('click', 'a, button, div.row div', containerClick); // prevent double-click

    function showPage2() {
        $('#pages').on('click', 'a, button, div.row div', containerClick); // prevent double-click

want var supplied to current() to be numeric
    but how do we get it from clicked el?
    do we need prefixes at all? as each svg has it's own namespace


all 4 test (all interactive)
practices have "begin" and "end" text
jon re timings
    30 sec timeout whole quiz
beware: keydown handler doesn't work when focus is on svg
larger, more spaced text

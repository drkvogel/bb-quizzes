## defer



fossil workflow too slow/labourious

(css?) errors reported by ff
.replace() e.g. `alert($("a").css("margin-top").replace("px", ""));`

`bb-quizzes/matrix/main-jon.js`
Iâ€™d just do something like this to centre the tiles of the matrix:  

```html
<div style="width: 75%; margin: auto">
    ...
</div>
```

css errors
tidy up matrix, hoops
send result by ajax (don't use submit)
dev prev button doesn't work now unless navbar fits on one line
shrink containing div - too big-
with `.top, .bot { width: 100%; }`, image map doesn't work-x
log IP?

## fossilised

matrix: centre divs
matrix: space lower tiles
matrix: add text
hoops: abandon button doesn't do anything
hoops: answers in config - depends on order...
hoops: puzzles are hard coded and not in pseudo-random order
prev, next should be closer together, and not off the bottom

sticky footer?
standardise text sizes

bower install imageMapResizer?
stose responsive test site?
range of normal aspect ratios
gulp desktop notification on error
or via browsersync

IIFE to prevent hoisting - but maybe we want global vars to maintain state?

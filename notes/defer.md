pandoc markdown \newpage and \pagebreak - neither seems to work

errors reported by ff

hide/showDiv should take whole jQuery selectors
cache image for next page

`bb-quizzes/matrix/main-jon.js`

hourglass if wait on submit?
//$("body").css("cursor", "progress"); // $("body").css("cursor", "default");
or
$(window).on('beforeunload', function(){
   $('*').css("cursor", "progress");
});
* If possible a busy/hourglass cursor could be displayed while data is uploading [don't spend more than an hour on this - if it's not easy to do, then forget it].  

uncomputable?
\newpage in pandoc worked!
.replace() e.g. `alert($("a").css("margin-top").replace("px", ""));`

prev, next should be closer together, and not off the bottom

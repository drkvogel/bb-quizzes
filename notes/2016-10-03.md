buttons scroll off bottom on phone - text too lengthy? too much spacing?
images should be bigger on phone

## defer

can use iife and wiredep to modularise? e.g. in matrix, imageMapResizer.js is an iife and is callable from main.js

stose css - did it work?
go-ahead to develop backend on oqshub if desired, push to oqsweb (xrat is being retired), and get some GUIs if needed.

codeblocks on oqshub/web
"linux-handy" - how so?

### wiredep / bower

if I take e.g. timer stuff out and put it in a separate file, and include that in the HTML, will wiredep link it up?
seems to work, but doesn't seemed to be wired... what if main.js loads before timer.js?
...because scripts are loaded synchronously?
and when you build it they'll be wired together in one file?
so you could take common stuff out and put it in (e.g.) libcog.js

## done

ay re X, IDE-
print out hoops layout diagram /home/kvogel/Projects/bb-quizzes/doc/hoops
Alter screen resizing algorithm - look at 2016-09-28.md but put some in code
Document hoops program

hoops doesn't scale automatically on page load, only on resize
    is called in showPage() - doesn't have all dimensions when called?
save results to backend fully â€“ should be simple to do now backend framework exists
use your scaling algorithm on Hoops instead of my simple one; needs re-investigation of page elements - pesticide
describe hoops scaling algorithm in documentation (this is why the Hoops documentation is still not complete)
cap int2 seconds fields on backend insert

### xfer bb-quizzes (backend) dev environment from xrat to oqshub

git cloned from xrat to oqshub:

    [cp@oqshub ~]$ git clone cp@xrat.ctsu.ox.ac.uk:~cp/Projects/bb-quizzes
    [cp@oqshub backend]$ git remote -v
    origin  cp@xrat.ctsu.ox.ac.uk:~/Projects/bb-quizzes/ (fetch)

are there any outstanding changes on oqsweb not in git? copy and compare on q108-vlubuntu:

    2016-10-03 14:40:13 cbird@q108-vlubuntu ~/Projects/tmp/bb-quizzes-oqsweb
    $ scp -rp cp@oqsweb.ndph.ox.ac.uk:~cp/cjb/proj/bb-quizzes/ .
    $ man scp
     -p      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.
     -r      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that scp follows symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

has index.cgi/bbquiz.cgi actually been built on oqsweb recently?

    [cp@oqsweb backend]$ ll index.cgi
    -rwxrwxr-x. 1 cp cp 4477198 Sep 26 11:33 index.cgi
    [cp@oqsweb backend]$ ll bbquiz.cgi
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 cp cp 6408789 Sep 27 17:12 bbquiz.cgi

not really. actual cgi on oqsweb is:

    [cp@oqsweb backend]$ ll ~/public_html/bbquiz/index.cgi
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 cp cp 4495265 Sep 29 16:20 /user/cp/public_html/bbquiz/index.cgi

looks like it came from xrat (if only I could remember what I did last week...):

    2016-10-03 15:20:18 cp@xrat ~/Projects/bb-quizzes/backend
    $ lr
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 cp cp 4495265 Sep 29 16:20 index.cgi

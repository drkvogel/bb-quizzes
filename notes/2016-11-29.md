In JavaScript, functions are objects. JavaScript functions have properties and methods.

`call()` and `apply()` are predefined JavaScript function methods. Both methods can be used to invoke a function, and both methods must have the owner object as first parameter. Both methods take an owner object as the first argument. The only difference is that **`call()` takes the function arguments separately**, and **`apply()` takes the function arguments in an array**.



### perfect generic scaling algorithm

scaleElement() called a number of times:

showPage()
    (twice, on puzzles?)
onresize
    (twice?)
    onresize will be called multiple times when resizing and showing contents. need to debounce.

A Pen by John Dugan (http://codepen.io/johndugan/pen/BNwBWL)

```js
var JD = {};

JD.debounce = function(func, wait, immediate) {
    var timeout;
    return function() {
        var context = this,
            args = arguments;
        var later = function() {
            timeout = null;
            if ( !immediate ) {
                func.apply(context, args);
            }
        };
        var callNow = immediate && !timeout;
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(later, wait || 200);
        if ( callNow ) { 
            func.apply(context, args);
        }
    };
};

JD.firstName = function() {
    console.log('John');
};

JD.lastName = function() {
    console.log('Dugan');
};
window.addEventListener('resize', JD.debounce(JD.lastName, 400));
window.addEventListener('resize', JD.debounce(JD.firstName, 400, true));

Extend documentation, including timings: when started,  cut-offs at various points, behaviour If time exceeded
click times should be deltas: Duration is delta from one question to next, elapsed is total time from beginning

Look at increasing throughput in SMS: (a) time-cutoff for sends, (b) interleaving by ID

## defer

leave

> minutes from today attached.  Please try to finish off the trail making this week - including the documentation.  I've moved our progress meeting to Tuesday 6th to allow for your Monday committment.
As we discussed, if you wish to take large chunks of time off between now and New Year then I've no objection in principle.  As we're not in the midst of a crisis I'm happy to waive the standard 2xDuration notice period for December and it will be fine it you book a lastminute.com type break and give me a couple of days notice.

structure, technology and sizing algorithms in the main web-page of the Matrices questionnaire. The document (in MS-Word) should contain at least:

pictorial representation of the <div>s in the page, accompanied by a brief description of the purpose of each.

Details of the image sizes and names of any included libraries (e.g. node.js)

ll/file
bower list
Bootstrap

A description (with pseudo-code) of the algorithm used to determine the scaling of the image elements.  This should be based around the method I outlined - i.e. determine separately the scaling in each of the horizontal and vertical directions required to fit the window, then resize using the smaller of these factors as a parameter.

how to: determine separately the scaling in each of the horizontal and vertical directions required to fit the window, then resize using the smaller of these factors as a parameter.

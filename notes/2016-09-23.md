Save results to database for matrix program
Save results to database for hoops program-
Modify some field types in database, int2 -> int1-


hoops doesn't scale automatically on page load, only on resize
    is called in showPage()
    doesn't have all dimensions when called?

save results to backend fully – should be simple to do now backend framework exists
use your scaling algorithm on Hoops instead of my simple one; needs re-investigation of page elements - pesticide
describe hoops scaling algorithm in documentation (this is why the Hoops documentation is still not complete)
cap int2 seconds fields on backend insert
work out why scaleImages jumps... cause there are two... why doesn't it work first time..

scaling not applied properly on show, even on same div as last page
    put scaleImages() in showPage2(), slight glitch but works

    simple scaling works - but not triggered at right time

buttons scroll off bottom on phone - text too lengthy? too much spacing?
images should be bigger on phone

matrix: do fade callback chaining
matrix: goes to complete.php
matrix: port hoops improvements
matrix: clear cruft to allow better comparison with hoops for common functions
general: common functions should be abstracted into library

sanitise inputs to backend?

### backend build problems

#### incorporate `nx_json_type_names` into `nxjson.c`

    // added
    char * nx_json_type_names[];
    2016-09-23 14:35:46 cp@xrat ~/Projects/bb-quizzes/backend
    $ make
    g++ -Dint_lnx -g -I/dbsystem/II/ingres/files   -c -o matrix.o matrix.cpp
    nxjson.h:63: error: storage size of ‘nx_json_type_names’ isn't known
    make: *** [matrix.o] Error 1

#### multiple definition of `Matrix::records'

if `records` is put in .h file, get multiple definition error:

    matrix.o: In function `~Answer':
    /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.1.2/../../../../include/c++/4.1.2/new:94: multiple definition of `Matrix::records'
    /tmp/cczMMSHA.o:/user/cp/Projects/bb-quizzes/backend/hoops.h:17: first defined here

if `records` is put in .cpp file (same name in hoops.cpp and matrix.cpp, get multiple definition error:

    2016-09-23 14:53:15 cp@xrat ~/Projects/bb-quizzes/backend
    $ make
    matrix.o: In function `~Answer':
    /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.1.2/../../../../include/c++/4.1.2/new:94: multiple definition of `records'
    hoops.o:/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.1.2/../../../../include/c++/4.1.2/new:94: first defined here

so have given them different names for now:

    Matrix::vecRecord MatrixRecords;

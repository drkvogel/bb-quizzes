Infosec training course

int4 -> int2 already done

default values for unanswered qs? no, put -1 in explicitly
puzzle, answer, correct fields can go to INT1

XTIME::set(const char * iso) must include seconds, e.g. `2016-08-15T16:30:00`


front end should put number for puzzle instead of string
thus only mapping is in config.json and code is kept DRY (not WET: ""written every time", write everything twice", "we enjoy typing" or "waste everyone's time".
that means parsing config.json on backend? to know which is correct? or put that in config.json as well
correct: isCorrect, ?

c++ template create code from loop at compile time?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6872919/compile-time-loops
>Loop unrolling is considered a common optimization in C++ compilers.

startTimer - I think is called at right time, but I take longer to click on the first puzzle
1st time looks wrong - too long, like time from page load, not test start:

    sesh_id: 1234
    parseResponses()
    [node type: NX_JSON_OBJECT, length: 5]: count: 1, puzzle: 't3w2y1b.png', answer: 1, correct: 1, time: 2829
    [node type: NX_JSON_OBJECT, length: 5]: count: 2, puzzle: 't3yw2b1.png', answer: 2, correct: 0, time: 229


reframe.js - https://dollarshaveclub.github.io/reframe.js/ - use this for bb-quizzes?


INTEGER1 (1 byte), which has a range of -128 - put in create-create.py
scaling not applied properly on show, even on same div as last page
    put scaleImages() in showPage2(), slight glitch but works

put ntests in payload and check with parsed responses on back end?

I said that "correct" in payload was the correct answer not a bool and that a bool could be derived - I don't think that's true, correct is a bool in payload

time elapsed is not in payload
nor tinstruct, etc

tiles look 
    huge on yoga3 Windows
        1920x1080, 150% dpi scaling
        ok on 100%
        ok (just) on 125%, for both grids
        both scroll off at 150%
    ok on yoga3-vlubuntu
        1920x1080, not scaled
    ok resolution on galaxy core prime but 3x3 bottom grid collapses, too much margin
        480 x 800 pixels (~207 ppi pixel density)

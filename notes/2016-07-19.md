Dear Chris, at our meeting today we agreed the workplan for the next 2 weeks (as I'm away next) to be:
* Implement the re-sizing algorithm for Matrix as specified previously.
* It is not necessary to support resolutions of less than 320 pixels horizontally. Algorithm can be capped to stop shrinking at this point.
* Implement re-sizing in Hoops and finish the interface for that program.
* Complete documentation for Matrix and produce similar for Hoops,
* Alter systems so that data is uploaded to server automatically when last screen in test is completed (Jonathan has working code for this which can provide template).  If possible a busy/hourglass cursor could be displayed while data is uploading [don't spend more than an hour on this - if it's not easy to do, then forget it].  After test is completed user should be directed to a simple "Thank You" screen.
If these jobs are all completed before I return then you can begin to look at putting Ingres back-ends onto the CGIs to receive the data. Next meeting 2nd August. Alan

please check yes/no too wide
because box `.my-modal-content` is fixed width:

```css
.my-modal-content {
    position: fixed;
    background-color: #FFF;
    border-radius: 5px;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 20px;
    top: 50%;            // centre in viewport
    left: 50%;           // but need to need to offset topleft corner with margns
    margin-left: -200px; // half of _width
    margin-top: -100px;  // half of _height
    z-index: 11;
    padding: 10px;
    height: 200px;
    width: 400px;
}
```

made <300px so should fit on any screen >300.

d for developer

end of quiz:
    should send results immediately rather than relying on user to submit for
    rather than send AJAX on completion, Jon has a method of submitting a form automatically with JavaScript
    easier to do on back end with xcgi.c instead of writing AJAX endpoint

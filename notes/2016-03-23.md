### images renamed

Wed Mar 23 17:32:25 2016
images seem to have been renamed to reflect intro1,2,3,getReady,ex1,ex2 etc... e.g. what is matrix_ex6.png on q108 windows copy is matrix_ex3.png in repo. don't remember doing that... actually, do, vaguely...
but one using matrix_ex3.png is borked anyway

yes, I copied the array wrongly. fixed now.




browsersync - probably - opens a browser (currently ff) to show the page on `gulp serve` - and also closes it when finished.

### matrix -> yo test merge

cos matrix was borked - probably because I removed some comments significant to yo/bower from index.html
so started again in yo-test and copied bits over

### scripts not being refreshed, 

even with `gulp serve` restart:

    cbird@q108-vlubuntu:~/Projects/bb-quizzes/matrix$ ll app/scripts/main.js 
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 cbird cbird 3.9K Mar  4 12:11 app/scripts/main.js
    cbird@q108-vlubuntu:~/Projects/bb-quizzes/matrix$ ll .tmp/scripts/main.js
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 cbird cbird 3.8K Mar  4 12:04 .tmp/scripts/main.js

because there are errors in yo script, g!

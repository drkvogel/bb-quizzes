    $ php -v
    PHP 5.2.17 (cli) (built: Mar  5 2015 04:03:50)

old, but OK.
suspect XSS blocked - need to use CORS? http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/
Though in real life it wouldn't be cross-domain - run it all on this box, or on kvogel.net, or wherever - even xrat has PHP! (thanks, me)

can serve PHP from gulp?
or node?

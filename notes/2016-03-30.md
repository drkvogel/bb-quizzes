### bad gulp-ssh

ex12 answer was probably wrong, changed from 6 to 1 in config.json
in bbquizzes.git, 
    matrix/app/config.json, ex12 answer is now 1
    matrix/dist/config.json, ex12 answer is now 1
did gulp-ssh sftp from yoga3-vlubuntu

13.55 timestamp looks right - server is in Amsterdam, 1hr behind the UK.

i.e. it said it had written the file (gulp-ssh), and the timestamp is updated - but the file is not!
file this as a bug...
or is there some "noclobber" setting?
or an error that I'm catching and not seeing?
use scp instead - wasted enough time on this
Wed Mar 30 16:16:36 2016 ok, scp seems to work reliably - as you'd expect.

### practice puzzle is different each time and should be fixed:

Jon-touchscreens.exe hoops fixed answer 
A t3yw2b1       t3yw2b1.png exists
B t3bw21y       t3bw21y.png exists

hoops
A t3bw2y1        aka top-constant.png
B (changes)

should be
A t3bw21y (same as exe B)   or 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3
B t3yw2b1                   or ...

top-constant is t3bw2y1

invert hoops logic - A-B <-> B-A
make picture B look like picture A
intro2 - swap images

now lower game image changes on resize....as each resize triggers showPage().... just rescale
follow levels[] data

good news: answers are correctly matched to images
but, the order doesn't seem right - got a lot of 5s right from the start
levels: 1,8,5,2,13,6,16,7,4,9,3,15,10,12,17,11,0,14
order of correct answers: 5 1 4 5 4 4 5 1 3 2 2 5 2 4 1 2 3 1
reversed: 1 3 2 1 4 2 5 2 2 3 1 5 4 4 5 4 1 5 (same as pseudoRandLevelList)
because wanted levels being popped off in reverse order
got a really difficult one first up: t3wyb21.png ans 5, correct
levels: 2,8,5,1,11,4,16,6,7,9,0,15,13,12,14,10,3,17
answered: 5, correct: 5, isCorrect: true main.js:516:9
Correct! main.js:536:13
puzzle.b: t3w2y1b.png, correct: t3w2y1b.png

clicks ignored after resize! unbound but not rebound?
timer didn't seem to time out, answered all 18 though going slow. total time == 409996 = 6.8 minutes? startTimer when on first puzzle
don't advance beyond game div until finished-
thanks page doesn't pause-

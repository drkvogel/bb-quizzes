### sms

Determine whether Clickatell allows multiple simultaneous sessions

https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/Clickatell/blob/master/clickatell.php so sez someone else:
>In order to deliver a message, the system needs to authenticate the request as coming from a valid source.
>You can have multiple sessions open, however the session ID will expire after fifteen minutes of inactivity.
>*This session ID must be used with all future commands to the API*, unless you authenticate each time within the command itself.

Investigate modifying SMS code to 
(1) Introduce "fairness" in SMS by alternating source [SQL developed by Geraint]
(2) Increase throughput in SMS by interleaving by ID - parameters -nX -mY meaning MOD(id,X)=Y

## defer

Noted that a custom linux server is being built to host the SMS system.
Noted CB on leave 16-23 Jan - meetings to be re-arranged.

## done

Extend documentation, including timings: when started,  cut-offs at various points, behaviour If time exceeded
Duration is delta from one question to next, elapsed is total time from beginning of individual test (of the 4)
Minor layout improvements regarding spacing of elements (e.g. upper text and abandon-button)

Alter pop text from "" to "If you answer Yes then"
Prevent clicking of Abandon button in interval between test completion and page changing to next test

### can't ssh out from oqsweb

index.cgi crashed on oqshub cause no `cp_web_test`... why build on oqshub? can build on oqsweb.. but can't git
oqshub can reach unfuddle, but...

    [cp@oqsweb proj]$ unset HISTFILE
    [cp@oqsweb proj]$ git clone git@drkvogel.unfuddle.com:drkvogel/bb-quizzes.git
    Cloning into 'bb-quizzes'...
    [no dice]
    ssh: connect to host drkvogel.unfuddle.com port 22: Connection timed out
    [cp@oqsweb proj]$ git clone cp@oqshub:~/proj/bb-quizzes
    Cloning into 'bb-quizzes'...
    [no dice]

i.e. can't ssh out from oqsweb
probably have to build backend on oqshub or oqsweb (or xrat...)
index.cgi crashed on oqshub cause no `cp_web_test`... why build on oqshub? can build on oqsweb.. but can't git

### How to inspect Javascript Objects

JSON.stringify
console.log(String(user))
console.log(user+"")
console.log(user.toString()) //?
console.dir(object)
typeof tells you which one of the 6 javascript types is the object
instanceof tells you if the object is an instance of another object
List properties with for(var k in obj)
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(anObjectToInspect) 
Object.getPrototypeOf(anObject)
anObject.hasOwnProperty(aProperty)
console.log(anObject.constructor); 
console.log(anObject.prototype);

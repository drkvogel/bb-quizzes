gulp-ssh ftp of dist folder not working properly... bb-quizzes/notes/2016-03-29 sftp.md

tiles look 
    huge on yoga3 Windows
        1920x1080, 150% dpi scaling
        ok on 100%
        ok (just) on 125%, for both grids
        both scroll off at 150%
    ok on yoga3-vlubuntu
        1920x1080, not scaled
    ok resolution on galaxy core prime but 3x3 bottom grid collapses, too much margin
        480 x 800 pixels (~207 ppi pixel density)

include js on browser? why, include it in the html - gulp will munge them together?

some answers wrong!
    ex12 should be bot1
    ex13 should be bot4?

### How to inspect Javascript Objects

JSON.stringify
console.log(String(user))
console.log(user+"")
console.log(user.toString()) //?
console.dir(object)
typeof tells you which one of the 6 javascript types is the object
instanceof tells you if the object is an instance of another object
List properties with for(var k in obj)
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(anObjectToInspect) 
Object.getPrototypeOf(anObject)
anObject.hasOwnProperty(aProperty)
console.log(anObject.constructor); 
console.log(anObject.prototype);

The most functional tool in controlling JavaScript memory usage and finding leaks is the new powerful Heap Profiler available in Chrome Dev Channel. To get a heap snapshot, open the Profiles panel in Developer Tools and press the “Take heap snapshot” button:

Snapshots contain every object from the JavaScript heap, so you can explore them in detail and find out how much memory every object of your application consumes.

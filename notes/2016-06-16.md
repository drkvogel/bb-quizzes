when first loaded, imagemap doesn't respond.
    no error in console
    it is a quiz2x2 template
    imageMapResize(); is being called - but is it, if page not resized?
    because of beenHere()?
        map._resize = resizeMap; //Bind resize method to HTML map element
        function beenHere() { return ('function' === typeof map._resize); }
$().ready() calls getConfig() calls init() - only then is page shown - call imageMapResize() in init, after showPage(), but no dice
        trick it by resizing?
        $ git clone https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/image-map-resizer
        Including the unminified version instead of the minified version makes it work first time without having to manually resize!

cursor doesn't change on hot areas in ff
    add `href="#"`, doesn't seem to clash with `nohref="nohref"`

imagemap does not match image on 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 - change map or image
on those images where the imagemap does not match, the border of the clickable `area` is left visible after showing the next page

the first live quiz is page 5, so 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 are

list of palette images, some of which don't match the imagemap:

     blank-3x2-palette.png:      PNG image data, 680 x 365
     blank-4x2-palette.png:      PNG image data, 755 x 295
     intro1/intro1-palette.png:  PNG image data, 680 x 365
     intro2/intro2-palette.png:  PNG image data, 680 x 365
     intro3/intro3-palette.png:  PNG image data, 755 x 295
     ex1/ex1-palette.png:        PNG image data, 755 x 295
     ex2/ex2-palette.png:        PNG image data, 680 x 365
     ex3/ex3-palette.png:        PNG image data, 680 x 365
     ex4/ex4-palette.png:        PNG image data, 680 x 365
     ex5/ex5-palette.png:        PNG image data, 680 x 365
    !ex6/ex6-palette.png:        PNG image data, 857 x 293
     ex7/ex7-palette.png:        PNG image data, 755 x 295
     ex8/ex8-palette.png:        PNG image data, 755 x 295
    !ex9/ex9-palette.png:        PNG image data, 857 x 293
    !ex10/ex10-palette.png:      PNG image data, 857 x 293
    !ex11/ex11-palette.png:      PNG image data, 857 x 293
    !ex12/ex12-palette.png:      PNG image data, 857 x 293
    !ex13/ex13-palette.png:      PNG image data, 858 x 293
    !ex14/ex14-palette.png:      PNG image data, 791 x 261
    !ex15/ex15-palette.png:      PNG image data, 860 x 284

i.e. the 3x3 ones that aren't 755 x 295
in ex7-palette.png, which is "correct", each tile is 170px x 135px, and the difference horizontally and vertically between each tile is 25px.
and in ex6, ex9, ex10, ex11 (roughly), 12, 13, 15; but the spacing is 56px horizontally and 17px vertically
ex14 is different: the tiles are roughly 100 x 100, and the spacing is 122 x 53, roughly - they are not consistent
think easier to doctor images to be same dimensions than to swap in different area maps..
saved palette-755Ã—295.xcf as template

to fit in the border of the tiles copied from ex7, the pasted area is 168 x 133
rather than carefully selecting 168 x 133 in the old palette image, carefully selecting same area within the target template:
fuzzy select inside border from source, add contents with rectangle select, add to current selection, copy, then:
fuzzy select inside border in destination, and do "Paste Into"

or: Colour Select all the whitespace, Invert Selection (ctrl-i), Rectangle Select with Intersect, copy, then paste into

in ex13, tiles have white inside them, so Colour Select was selecting that as well...

Now have a 755 x 295 version of ex6

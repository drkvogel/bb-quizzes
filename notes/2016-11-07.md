## defer

trails, hoops abandon modal bit wonky - copy from matrix?
scaling - stose
quizzes on mobiles generally - should use all available space

## done

Add derived columns - store elapsed duration in deciseconds (int2) + mistakes between this and previous question (int1)
    For each circle we record
    (1) time it was correctly clicked (deciseconds); Absolute time since the screen was first displayed. INT2 capped at 9999
    (2) number of incorrect clicks made between previous circle and this one. INT1 capped at 99
    done?
remove margins etc, more space for svg-/

### If form data empty, XEXEC errors

shouldn't be attempted. should have bombed out at that point, instead of trying to insert into db

    only picks up error when trying to turn empty date into string:
    tinstruct.iso(): 'ERROR'
    XTIME::invalid_serialization = "ERROR"
    XDATE::iso( void ) 
    throw error if sesh_id is 0

change trails.cpp, backport to hoops.cpp, matrix.cpp

Include timings for practise puzzles- make practice-a|b record clicks-
errorneous clicks should be recorded as just the number of incorrect clicks before the correct button is pressed in each case-

### Trails::parseResponses():didn't get json

submit from l151-vlubuntu didn't work - "didn't get json" if quiz abandoned or timed out before finish
    because I moved stuff in main.js?

```js
function modalClick(e) {
    case 'abandon-yes':
        showPage(pageNamed('thanks'));
}
function showPage(page) { 
    case 'thanks':
        setTimeout(finished, 3000);
}
function finished() {
    document.getElementById('sesh_id').value = config.seshID;
    ...
}
```

do other tests fail insert if abandoned or timed out? matrix - no; hoops, no

split create-create.py into separate games
duration is still delta not absolute- fixed-
practices have "begin" and "end" text

media queries for text and buttons

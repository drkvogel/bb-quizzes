split create-create.py into separate games
make practice-a|b record clicks
errorneous clicks should be recorded as just the number of incorrect clicks before the correct button is pressed in each case

## progress

### objectives

Include timings for practise puzzles
Add derived columns - store elapsed duration in deciseconds (int2) + mistakes between this and previous question (int1)
Extend documentation, including timings: when started,  cut-offs at various points, behaviour if time exceeded
Begin looking at scaling


### details

> Could you remind me please what we decided regarding the timings for the trails puzzle, specifically: Are we recording every click, correct or not?

No.  For each circle we record
(1) time it was correctly clicked (deciseconds);
(2) number of incorrect clicks made between previous circle and this one.

> Is a click stored as a delta time or absolute time since the particular section was started?

Absolute time since the screen was first displayed.

> With what precision should the click times be stored?

Item (1) is INT2 capped at 9999,  item (2) is INT1 capped at 99.

> With an arbitrary number of timings, how will we store them in the database? e.g. as a JSON blob?

The scheme above means you only get 2 values for each circle displayed so there isn't an arbitrary number.
I don't know whether it's best to store the 4 tests in separate tables or one big one (with lots of columns left at -1 for the shorter tests).

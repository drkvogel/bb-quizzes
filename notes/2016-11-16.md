Scale to allow for height

thought: why am I adding up the heights of everything on the page when I could do (height of body) - (height of element to be scaled) and scale vs window.height?
in fact, could genericise:

```js
function scaleElement(elementSelector) {
   var heightExtra = $("body").height() - $(elementSelector).height();
   ...
}
```

    timings: 
        when started
        cut-offs at various points
        behaviour if time exceeded

### jon re timing

Even latest versions of IE (11) bunch events if load is high. End the **most recent**, rather than the longest outstanding event will then be triggered. This caused some negative time deltas in the Healthy Minds quiz - i.e. subsequent events appeared to have happened before each other. This happened in a small number of cases (e.g. 7 in 10,0000) in testing. No workaround was found.

In the case of the trails quiz, there are two potential issues:
1) Delta times could be wrong
2) Events could trigger in the wrong order and put the application in an unintended state - e.g. it might cease to function in the correct manner.

Regarding these two points:
1) The potential timing errors were in the range >10 milliseconds, and the precision of the timings gathered is deciseconds, and not critical - the aggregate data is what is required
2) i) The potential time error should be much less than a human is able to generate clicks on separate (circle) elements. Therefore it should not be possible for click events to be handled in the wrong order.
   ii) Even if it were possible for the events to be handled in the wrong order, it should not put the application in an unstable state - a correct click might be interpreted as a wrong one or vice versa - but the application should be able to handle that anyway and the impact to the user and to the timings would be minor.

answer fields in trails db should be NOT NULL and have COMMENT-?
could have used defs in svgs to simplify: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/defs-element.html
Begin looking at scaling

## done

media queries:
text bigger on large viewports
svg numbers smaller on large viewports

Increase smaller text font
Add derived columns - store elapsed duration in deciseconds (int2) + mistakes between this and previous question (int1)
Increase size of numbers within circles

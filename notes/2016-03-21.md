reliably transition from one page to the next

## defer

IIFE to prevent hoisting - but maybe we want global vars to maintain state?
separate structure for answers?

## done

JSON data structure for each page, with: sprite sheet to use indices into sprite sheet correct answer player's answer next page? `config.json`
ah, $.getJSON() is async, so config may or may not be loaded (probably not) by the time showPage() is run
showPage() on completion

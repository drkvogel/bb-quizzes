layout - OK, well currently, though the layout is flexible, the grid images are fixed size so don't fit on many devices (but does on my phone?)

show zoom level

https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoom


```css
body,html{
  height:100%;
}
div#right{
  height:100%
}
```

For columns that are not starting at the top of the page (for example: if they are starting below the header).

```html
<script>
     $(document).ready(function () {
        var column_height = $("body").height();
        column_height = column_height - 100; // 100 is the header height
        column_height = column_height + "px";
        $("#column").css("height",column_height);
    });
</script>
```

### [modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)

`html class=" js flexbox flexboxlegacy ..."`? modernizr

>It’s a collection of superfast tests – or “detects” as we like to call them – which run as your web page loads, then you can use the results to tailor the experience to the user.

>Modernizr makes it easy to deliver tiered experiences: make use of the latest and greatest features in browsers which support them, without leaving less fortunate users high and dry.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernizr
>designed to detect HTML5 and CSS3 features in various browsers, which lets JavaScript avoid using unimplemented features or use a workaround such as a shim to emulate them. 

>creates a JavaScript object named `Modernizr` that contains the results of these tests as boolean properties. It also adds classes to the HTML element based on what features are and are not natively supported.

>The library is simply a feature-detection method and as such, does not add missing functionality to older browsers.

e.g. 

```js
  if (Modernizr.canvas) {
    // let's draw some shapes!
  } else {
    // no native canvas support available :(
  }
```

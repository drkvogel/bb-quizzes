### config array vs object

    function pageNamed(name) {
        var page = pages[name]; // doesn't work - pages is an array of objects, must be indexed with number

should perhaps make config.json one big object, instead of an array of objects - difficult to find named page.
each page might then need to specify which should come after it...

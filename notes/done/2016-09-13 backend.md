http://xrat/~cp/bbquiz/idserve.cgi insert date/random number- parse-
%s instead of %d segfault, schoolboy C++ error
jQuery seems to have escaped JSON.stringify(responses) - copy from view-source, doublequotes copy as `&quot;`

### hoops.o makefile weirdness

looks like responses are put in hidden input from hoops on red, but doesn't seem to trigger correct part of backend, as though there were no parameters
crashed, that's why. too big?

    [cp@red sql]$ sudo less /var/log/httpd/error_log
    [Tue Sep 13 18:41:50 2016] [error] [client 10.140.150.200] terminate called after throwing an instance of 'char const*',

doesn't look like hoops.o got built any time recently... well, 16:45 today
make clean make bbquiz - doesn't build - hadn't noticed $(OJBS) appearing twice in make target
now bbquiz.cgi calls into hoops.o

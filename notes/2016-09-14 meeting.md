hoops doesn't scale automatically on page load, only on resize
    is called in showPage()
    doesn't have all dimensions when called?

save results to backend fully â€“ should be simple to do now backend framework exists
use your scaling algorithm on Hoops instead of my simple one; needs re-investigation of page elements - pesticide
describe hoops scaling algorithm in documentation (this is why the Hoops documentation is still not complete)
buttons scroll off bottom on phone - text too lengthy? too much spacing?
images should be bigger on phone

int2 -> int4 - cap seconds on backend
use url to send sesh_id 
oqhhub.ndph.ox.ac.uk, oqhweb.ndph.ox.ac.uk - have cp accounts. move dev there at some point
 have git. apache2.4 has suexec off by default, .so is in a folder somewhere, not configurable by httpd.conf
 for web progs need to grant apache access to Ingres dbs
 for sequence as well as table - doesn't cascade

Makefile weirdness - `$(OJBS)` appears twice in each build command - make separate defines for each build

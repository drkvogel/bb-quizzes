hoops doesn't scale automatically on page load, only on resize
    is called in showPage()
    doesn't have all dimensions when called?

save results to backend fully â€“ should be simple to do now backend framework exists
use your scaling algorithm on Hoops instead of my simple one; needs re-investigation of page elements - pesticide
describe hoops scaling algorithm in documentation (this is why the Hoops documentation is still not complete)

cap int2 seconds fields on backend insert
use url to send sesh_id 

## defer

buttons scroll off bottom on phone - text too lengthy? too much spacing?
images should be bigger on phone

have cp accounts. move dev there at some point
have git. apache2.4 has suexec off by default, .so is in a folder somewhere, not configurable by httpd.conf
for web progs need to grant apache access to Ingres dbs
for sequence as well as table - doesn't cascade

Makefile weirdness - `$(OJBS)` appears twice in each build command - make separate defines for each build

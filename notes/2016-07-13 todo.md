    abandon still scrolls off in some dimensions - does it? (`#abandon-div` is outside `#page`)
    js keeps it roughly square but that is not exactly what we want, too much whitespace at the bottom for a start
    abandon button vanishes

## defer

css errors
tidy up matrix, hoops
send result by ajax (don't use submit)
dev prev button doesn't work now unless navbar fits on one line
shrink containing div - too big-
with `.top, .bot { width: 100%; }`, image map doesn't work-x
log IP?

## done

comparing app-imagemap with app-aycalc, was missing recent tweaks - forgot about app-lessdivs
try matrix on smallest browserstack browser- bb-quizzes/notes/2016-07-13 smallest screen.md

text full width-
get ready text too small-
start button should be further from text-
time limit is now 3 mins-

remember (e.g.):
`#getReady.buttons` matches `<div id="getReady" class="buttons">`
`#getReady .buttons ` matches `<div id="getReady"><div class="buttons">`

Dear Chris, just to record the outcomes from our meeting today. Firstly we noted you were either ill or on leave for most of the time since our last meeting so it's not unreasonable that most of the ToDos from then remain undone. The carry-over actions from last week are:
* Implement the re-sizing algorithm as described in last weeks email and annotated on the paper copy of your documentation.  Update the documentation to match.
* Add a generic description of the images used in the system - i.e. say how big the various "icons" are and the spacings between them for the 2 layouts.
* Produce a similar document for the Hoops system.
I think the above should all be achievable within a week.
New item:
* Investigate (briefly!) what is the smallest mobile phone screen we are likely to encounter so some lower limit can be put on the 'shrinkability' of the interface.
Also:
* I said that it's not necessary for all the instructional text on the training pages to be visible (it's fine for users to scroll at this point in the process) so you don't need to spend time calculating the size of the div box containing that text as the screen changes size.
* I noted that you arrived at 11ish and emailed then to say that you'd been late due to oversleeping.  I asked that, in future, you ring from home prior to coming in so we know as early as possible that you will be in.
Regards, Alan

pointer doesn't change over clickable areas now? some images wrong-

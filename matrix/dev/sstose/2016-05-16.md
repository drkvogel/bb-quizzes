Hi Chris,

Well, I’ve spent quite a bit of time on this, no spinning my wheels. 

Results:  An interesting start. I’m going to put this all on a branch entitled “stose_responsive” and push?  Well, I guess not. I just did so, but could not push as a new tracking branch: I need your GitHub username/pass in order to do so. Duh.  Let me know how to proceed.

So, instead I’m attaching the two files, `main_js.txt` and `main_scss.txt` with the necessary changes. Please do have a look at how these function. You will see a noticeable change (at least for the first two sprites in the test). Don’t get too excited, however, maybe only a faux-solution...

What I did:

The principles enough are clear.  It cannot be done, as is, with only CSS, without changing the formula that govern your sprite-shifting, using your JS `pos` variable and the use of percentages instead of pixels.  That is, instead of shifting based on 2x2 = 210 and 3x3 = 170, it seems that you’ll need to shift any spirte that has 5 elements by 20%, 6 elements by 16.6%, and/or 4 elements by 25% etc., and then run you negative shifting in that respect: 

    pos = ‘-‘ + (width * top[i]) + ‘% auto’;

I had some luck with this, even though background-position should be (x, y) only, without ‘auto’, this despite not quite following the ‘width * top’ calculation here.  It also implies doing the calculation correctly using the constants (WIDTH2X2 etc.). 

The key is to shrinkwrap the original image with a parent div, so that the image contained in the child div — when provided a percentage value — will scale relative to how its orginal size. Shrinkwrapping enabling properties include: float:left/right, position: fixed/absoute, display:block, display:inline-block, min/max-width (and CSS3: width: intrinsic). Thus, you need:

```html
<span>
<img src=“…”/>
</span>
```

```css
span {display:block;}
img {width: 50%}
```

Now, the img scales with the browser. This is the first thing we need for each of your sprites, i.e., for them, as a whole (before windowed off through the sprite-shifting), to resize based on the browser resizing. Seems easy enough, but this must be done in the JS, somewhere around where you first introducet the image:

    $(sel).css(‘background-image’, img);

It seems these images are introduced in `<div id=“bot1,2,3”>`, or at:

```css
div#quiz2x2 div.grid2x2 div.row div,
div#quiz2x2 div.grid3x2 div.row div {
    background-image: none;
    background-image: no-repeat;
    float: left;
    padding: 8%;   *see note
    margin: 10px;
    width: 15%;
}
```

I’m not sure why you also have “background-image: none;”.  In any case, this does not seem to be effecing the img src itself, but only the window. That is, the window itself (at least for the first two test images) does seem to work, and resize according to browser width. Also, I cannot get the height to work. This should.  However, and very strangly, it is the “padding” here which provides the height. I’m not sure why, and fell upon it by 

Thus, in theory, this should actually control the image src itself, and resize it, assuming that is you shrinkwrap the parent div, which seems to me to be in the .row above:

```css
div#quiz2x2 div.grid2x2 div.row,
div#quiz2x2 div.grid3x2 div.row {
    display: block;
}
```

However, I do so to no avail.

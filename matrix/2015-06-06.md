differences in main.js, main.scss, index.html, images
e.g.  main looks same as jprice as 2images as sstose

## done

hack app-imagemap/images/images into app-imagemap
image maps in html- 3x2 4x2
js: capture events from correct elements-
config.json: display correct images
 don't need "sheet": "intro1.png", "images": {"top": [4, 4, 4], "bottom": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] },
 problem, palette and solution images can be worked out from page name

jQuery to get element name: `$("#elementId").prop('tagName');`. returns tag type in caps. 
clicking on image map returns two events, on AREA and MAP.

## image map learns

* GIMP has an ImageMap plugin (Filters (not Tools) -> Web -> Image Map...) to make making image maps quicker.
* The `usemap` attribute of `<img>` is what connects it to the `<map>`. `#` prefix seems to be necessary in this link.
* If you hover over the parts of the map with devtools open and the element picker enabled, the parts of the map will be hightlighted.
* The fact that the name has spaces, e.g. `usemap="#3x2 matrix image map"` does not seem to matter.
* If there is a "default" shape, i.e. `<area shape="default" href="#" />`, then the whole map is clickable even if there are gaps between the hot areas, and this specifies the default link - not what we want in this case. i.e. removing this line means the spaces between the choices in the matrix lower grid (the "palette") are not clickable.

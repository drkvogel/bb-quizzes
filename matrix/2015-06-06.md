images are not responsive anyway:
don't have width set
but percentage width throws out image map
top and bottom images are not same size, maybe should be - makes difficult to scale both by the same ratio

general.git?

add fade between pages - can't tell if progressed or not

    function hideDiv(id) { $('#' + id).fadeOut('fast');
    function showDiv(id) { $('#' + id).slideDown();

## defer

differences in main.js, main.scss, index.html, images
e.g.  main looks same as jprice as 2images as sstose
compare with http://red.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/~cp/cjb/sstose/
use classes for map areas?

## done

hack app-imagemap/images/images into app-imagemap
image maps in html- 3x2 4x2
js: capture events from correct elements-
config.json: display correct images
 don't need "sheet": "intro1.png", "images": {"top": [4, 4, 4], "bottom": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] },
 problem, palette and solution images can be worked out from page name

jQuery to get element name: `$("#elementId").prop('tagName');`. returns tag type in caps. 
clicking on image map returns two events, on AREA and MAP.
3x3-4x2 images not changing - also called #top and #bot, need to be more specific with selectors
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6850471/jquery-selector-for-duplicate-ids
>Duplicate IDs are invalid HTML and will nearly always cause issues with scripting. Avoid if at all possible.
i.e. use classes instead for images top, bot

explanation text

since when was Chrome DevTools shortcut `ctrl+shift+i`? and not `F12`? It is both. But keyboard handler was intercepting.
remember you can see what a selector does by typing it, jquery-style, in the dev console.

## image map learns

* GIMP has an ImageMap plugin (Filters (not Tools) -> Web -> Image Map...) to make making image maps quicker.
* The `usemap` attribute of `<img>` is what connects it to the `<map>`. `#` prefix seems to be necessary in this link.
* If you hover over the parts of the map with devtools open and the element picker enabled, the parts of the map will be hightlighted.
* The fact that the name has spaces, e.g. `usemap="#3x2 matrix image map"` does not seem to matter.
* If there is a "default" shape, i.e. `<area shape="default" href="#" />`, then the whole map is clickable even if there are gaps between the hot areas, and this specifies the default link - not what we want in this case. i.e. removing this line means the spaces between the choices in the matrix lower grid (the "palette") are not clickable.

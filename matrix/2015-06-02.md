schoolboy error:
was trying to add keyboard handler, but it was executing once at the start despite no keypress, then not responding to keypresses. Had done:

    $("body").on('keydown', mykeydown());   // note brackets, calls function

instead of 

    $("body").on('keydown', mykeydown);     // no brackets - reference to function object

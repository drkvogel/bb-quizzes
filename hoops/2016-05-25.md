### hoops order

pseudo-random - there are 18 levels and the sequence of correct answers will always be the same - `m_sudoRndLevelList` - but which puzzle with that particular answer is picked from a pool - 4 for each answer - from `m_TOLgameData` - `m_answers` says which is which:

```cpp
    // levelData.cpp
    const int levelData::m_answers[MAX_LEVELS] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5};
    int levelData::m_rndLevel[MAX_LEVELS] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17};
    int levelData::m_sudoRndLevelList[MAX_LEVELS] = {1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 5, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 1, 5};
```

this is what to draw for each of the 18 games - 6-tuples where 0 is no hoop, 1, 2, 3 are each colour hoops, and the 3-tuple, pair and single values are what's on each stick:

```cpp
    // TowerOfLondonGame.cpp
    const int TOWEROFLONDON_GAME::m_TOLgameData[18][6] =
        {0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3}, {3, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0},
        {0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1}, {0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1}, {0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3},
        {0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 2}, {0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1}, {0, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0},
        {0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 0}, {0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0}, {0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0},
        {0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2}, {0, 2, 3, 0, 1, 0},
        {0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0}, {2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0};
    const int TOWEROFLONDON_GAME::m_TOL_wantedGameData[6] = {0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0};
```

### CSS for mobiles

Smartphones may well identify themselves as a screen type of device with regards to the CSS @media property. There isn't a specific non-deprecated media property for smartphones, but their screen sizes are usually small (e.g. 480 pixels). So here's an extract from a CSS file that uses the max-width property to identify which CSS styles to used, to implement the above mobile / nonmobile CSS classes.

```css
    span.nonmobile { display: inline; } /* default is to display */
    span.mobile { display: none; } /* default is to hide */
    @media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
      span.nonmobile { display: none; } /* will override previous instruction if on a small screen */
      span.mobile { display: inline; }
    }
```

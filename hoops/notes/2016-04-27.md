    div layout can be the same as a table, but tables have styles by default (and can't be changed?)
>CSS Table has a key differentiation over HTML Table. It can choose not to be a table by just adjusting its CSS properties. Something that HTML Table is incapable of.

### the viewport

       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp

>when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport.
>browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen - not always desirable

so meta viewport initial-scale=1 is not working on my phone?

I am hoping that your inline HTML style elements are not generated by Javascript. - the style attribute is
a matter of finding our where the inline HTML style elements are generated, and seeing if we can change these to %-based widths etc., as per the links above. - tried that? 
using CSS media-queries to establish breakpoints, and differently sized images depending on the size of the browser

what happens if I take matrix grids out of `class="content"`?
what does `container` get you?

### js module bundling / [Splitting JS across files](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16749870/splitting-javascript-into-several-files)

Several methods:

* [Namespace Objects](https://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/)
* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) ([AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition))
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) ([CommonJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html))

e.g.

    // file 1
    (function(){
        cog = cog || {};
        cog.myvar = ...;
        cog.myfunc = function(){...};
    })();
    
    // file 2
    (function(){
        cog = cog || {};
        myaapp.myothervar = ...
        cog.myotherfunc = function(){...};
        cog.start = function(){...};
        }
    })();
    
    // last file
    $(cog.start);

[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html)?
IIFE means "use strict" only has to be declared once per file, but now can't access funcs across files... http://gregfranko.com/blog/i-love-my-iife/

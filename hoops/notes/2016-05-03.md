### Bootstrap container width

    // /home/cbird/Projects/bb-quizzes/hoops/yo/app/styles/main.scss
    // bower:scss
    @import "bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss";
    // endbower

`bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss` sets:

    .container {
        max-width: 730px;
    }

which makes it too narrow on the desktop for the quizzes. Why does it set that, and not a percentage?
in `main.scss`, it does:

    /* Responsive: Portrait tablets and up */
    @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
      .container {
        max-width: 730px;
    }

## defer

Should use classes rather than IDs for my CSS as there are multiple layouts with the same names in the same page.

red upload: does `red` script work from `cbird@q108-vlubuntu` (where upload to `xrat` does not)? Yes

semantic naming system for towers of hanoi problem, e.g. for first intro screen (intro1.png):

    t3b2u1w     # 3-level tower has black ring, 2-level has yellow, 1-level has white (t for tower, id must start with a letter not a number)
    t3b2wy1     # 3-level tower has black ring, 2-level has white on top then yellow, 1-level has none

Why is CSS so difficult?
With (e.g. JS) coding, you're in control - you can see your code, or someone else's, and what it's supposed to do. 
With CSS, there is this unseen layout engine with its own inner workings, and you have to understand how it works to write your "code".

### centering elements

Centre block within containing block:

```css
#content {
  width: 80%;           // or px or em or anything less than 100% - must be set
  margin: auto;
}
```

Centre content *inside* the block:

    text-align: center;
